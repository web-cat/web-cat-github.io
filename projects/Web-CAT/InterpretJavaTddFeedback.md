## Problem 

You have submitted a Java assignment to Web-CAT and you want to know how to
interpret the feedback results you received.  This recipe applies if your assignment
was graded using the [JavaTddPlugin](JavaTddPlugin/).

## Solution 

We're still working on this recipe, so we've just got some starter information
for now.

For a summary, see the [Submission Walkthrough](SubmissionWalkthrough.html) movie (24Mb, 5min), which
also provides a basic walkthrough of how to interpret the feedback results
for a Java submission graded using the [JavaTddPlugin](JavaTddPlugin/).
