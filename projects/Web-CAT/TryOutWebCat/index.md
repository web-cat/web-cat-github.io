## Try Out Web-CAT 

I know some of you are mostly interested in trying out Web-CAT to
see if it might work for a course you're teaching.  That's great.

To try out Web-CAT yourself, fill out this online request form:

[Trial account request form](needs-form-url.txt)

Follow our [Usage Instructions](UsageInstructions.html) once you receive
confirmation that your account has been created.

If you like the way Web-CAT works, you can
[Use Web Cat Remotely](../UseWebCatRemotely.html) in your course when you start out.
