## Test-Driven Development 

Test-driven development (TDD) is all about writing "**clean code that
works**."  It is also known as **test-first coding**.
Here are some quotes (from Kent Beck) that intuitively describe
TDD:

    The style here is to write a few lines of code, then a test that should run, or even better, to write a test that won't run, then write the code that will make it run.
    ...
    [After figuring out how to write one small piece of code ...] Now, instead of just coding on, we want to get immediate feedback and practice "code a little, test a little, code a little, test a little." [... So we immediately write a test for it.]

TDD grew out of [Extreme Programming](http://www.xprogramming.com),
ad evolved from the simple XP idea of "build a little, test a little"
during coding.  Basically, your code always has a complete set of tests
that exercises its capabilities, and you write new tests as you add to
your code.  Practiced systematically, TDD:

* Gives you **confidence** that your code works correctly
* Helps you quickly find bugs as you write them
* Focuses you on the design task
* Helps you completely understand the requirements for your code

### Learning About TDD 

To learn more about TDD, the first place to start is the following
(easy to read) classic:

* Kent Beck and Erich Gamma. [Test infected: Programmers love writing tests](http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm). _Java Report_, 3(7), July 1998.

While the Java stuff may not apply, the basic practices and emphasis of
TDD are well-presented.  Next, the following two articles are **required
reading** for getting a good overall view of TDD:

* Kent Beck. [Aim, fire [test-first coding](http://computer.org/software/homepage/2001/05Design/index.htm)]. _IEEE Software_, 18(5): 87-89, Sept.[/ Oct](/Oct.html). 2001.
* Dave Astels. [What is test-driven development?](http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,29690,00.html) _The Coad Letter_, issue 93, 2002.

Finally, if you'd like to dig into TDD more deeply, you might find the
following sources useful:

* Kent Beck's book, _Test-driven Development: By Example_, Addison-Wesley, 2003.  He posted a draft that is [available on-line](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/files/TDD17Jul2002.pdf).
* [JUnit.org's test first articles](http://www.junit.org/news/article/test_first/index.htm)
* Dave Astels. [Why test?](http://www.thecoadletter.com/issues/testdriven/coadletter-testdriven-095_why_test.htm) _The Coad Letter_, issue 95, 2002.
* Dave Astels. [JUnit](http://www.thecoadletter.com/issues/testdriven/coadletter-testdriven-102_junit.htm). _The Coad Letter_, issue 102, 2002.
