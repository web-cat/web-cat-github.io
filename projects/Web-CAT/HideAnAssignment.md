title: Hide An Assignment
---
## Problem 

You want to hide an assignment from students while you test it out
yourself, or make adjustments to its configuration.  Hiding it
prevents students from making any new submissions.

## Solution 

This recipe assumes that you have already created an assignment (see
[Create An Assignment](CreateAnAssignment.html)).

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Assignments** tab:

<img href="img/assignments-properties-tab.png"/>

**Note:** only users who have instructor permissions can create new
assignments.  If you don't have instructor permissions, you will not see
the **Assignments** tab at all.  If this is the case,
[Contact Your Administrator](ContactYourAdministrator.html) for assistance.

**Step 1: Pick the course**.  Click the radio button next to the
course offering for which you want to edit an assignment.  Once you've
picked the course offering, click "Next".

**Step 2: Pick the assignment**.  You will see the list of
assignments that you have already created for this course offering.
Select the assignment you wish to edit.  Click "Next".

**Step 3: Edit assignment properties**.  This page shows both the
shared **properties for all instances of this assignment**, as well
as the **properties unique to this course offering**.

Under the properties unique to this course offering, **uncheck**
the box labeled **"Publish it"**.  Click "Finish".

Students will no longer be able to see the assignment or make new
submissions.  To make the assignment visible to students, return to
this point and check the "Publish it" box again.

## Discussion 

Course staff, including both graders and instructors, can still see
the assignment even when it is unpublished.  It will only be hidden
from students enrolled in the course.

Be sure you do not accidentally leave the assignment unpublished, or
students will not be able to make submissions at all.
