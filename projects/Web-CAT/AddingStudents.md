title: Adding Students

## Problem 

You want to add one or more students to an existing course offering
that you manage.

## Solution 

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Courses** tab, and then click the **Properties** subtab:

<img href="img/courses-properties-tab.png"/>

**Note:** only users who have instructor permissions can edit
course offerings.  If you don't have instructor permissions, you will
not see the **Courses** tab at all.  If this is the case, contact your
Web-CAT administrator for assistance.

**Step 1: Pick the course**.  Click the radio button next to the
course offering you want to edit.  Once you've picked the course
offering, click "Next".

**Step 2: Edit course properties**.  You can use this page to
edit the URL associated with your course offering, or you can use the
**Add** buttons to [Add Another Instructor](AddAnotherInstructor.html) or [Add Another Grader](AddAnotherGrader.html).
Click "Next".

**Step 3: Edit student roster**.  This page allows you to enter or
modify the list of students enrolled in your course offering.  At the
top of the page, you will see a list of students who are currently
enrolled in your course offering.

Next, you'll see a box for uploading a student roster in CSV format.

Finally, you'll see a multi-paged list of all user accounts on
Web-CAT, with "Add" buttons so that you can individually add new
students.

If you want to **upload a list of students all at once**, then
read how to [Upload Your Course Roll](UploadYourCourseRoll.html).  Note that you can use the
upload procedure to upload groups of new students even after you've
already set up your course roll (it won't delete any existing
students).

If you want to **create new accounts** for students who are
enrolled in your course offering, but who do not yet have Web-CAT
accounts, then [Upload Your Course Roll](UploadYourCourseRoll.html).

If you want to add one or more students to your course roster, one at
a time, without uploading a CSV file, then you can use the list of
current user accounts at the bottom of this Web-CAT page.  You can
use the icons next to the User ID and Name column headers to sort
up or down by either field.  Page through the list, and then
**Click the "Add" button** next to the individual(s) you want to
enroll in your course.  This method only works for users who already
have accounts on your Web-CAT server.

## Discussion 

If you want to add a student who does not yet have a Web-CAT account,
the only way to do it is by uploading a CSV file (even if it has only
one entry).

You cannot use CSV files to remove (drop) students.
