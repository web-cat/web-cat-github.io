title: How To Contribute
---
Several individuals have expressed an interest in contributing to Web-CAT's development, often because they were working (or planning to work) on their own grader and wanted to build on an existing system if they could.  If that sounds like you, then I need your help!  However, it isn't going to be too easy.

The following linked pages lay out the current situation so we can figure out an appropriate path forward to work together.

## Extending Web-CAT's Grading Abilities 

For the person who wishes to use Web-CAT in one or more courses without becoming a web application developer:

* You can [Try Out Web Cat](TryOutWebCat/)
, and if it looks appropriate for your course, you can volunteer to [Use Web Cat Remotely](UseWebCatRemotely.html) at your school from our server.
* The [Plugin Guide](PluginGuide.html) explains how you can extend or write entirely new grading plug-ins for your own assignments, without needing to know anything about Web-CAT's implementation or work on its source code.
* [Add Languages](AddLanguages.html) explains how easy it is to support new languages on Web-CAT (without any code changes).

## Contributing to the Web-CAT Application Itself 

For adventurers with more ambitious goals:

* Remember that you can [Add Grading Scripts](AddGradingScripts.html) or [Add Languages](AddLanguages.html) without having to change Web-CAT's source code and without having to learn all the corresponding internal gunk about how it is implemented.
* While creating an [Open Source Web Cat Project](OpenSourceWebCatProject.html) has posed some challenges, we are close to overcoming them all.  As a result, our [SourceForge Project](SourceForgeProject.html) will be the center of collaborative development on Web-CAT.
* We are planning to work toward a [Continuous Integration Server](ContinuousIntegrationServer.html) to support communal development, although we are not there yet.  We have an appropriate linux server available for this purpose, but do not yet have the manpower to set up all the continuous integration machinery.

## Contributing to Our Eclipse Plug-ins 

If you are interested in adding to our [Eclipse Plugins](EclipsePlugins/)
, think about joining our [SourceForge Project](SourceForgeProject.html).  We would be happy for additional development help.

## Summary 

OK, if you've read the links above, you now know that  Web-CAT is a big
hairy beast.  No surprise.  However, if you've
read this far, then you probably have a pretty good idea of what kind
of involvement you'd like to get into.  First, if you just want to [Try Out Web Cat](TryOutWebCat/)

on my server to see how things work, then by all means let me know.
I need to know what programming
language you want to use for assignments, whether or not you've used
any kind of automated grader before, what experience you have with
XUnit-style frameworks for your language, and your time line.  If too
many people fall into this category, I may not be able to handle
everyone at once, but I'll deal with that problem when (and if) it
occurs.

Second, if you want to _work_ on Web-CAT, either to build your own
grading features on top of it or to contribute to its current
capabilities, let me know what you think regarding a "traditional"
sourceforge project vs. a local continuous integration server.  I'd
definitely like to hear about what you are interested in doing, and
how we might make it work.

So, that's probably more info than you wanted.  At least now you'll
know the nasty details behind the scenes.
