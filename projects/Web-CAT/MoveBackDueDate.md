title: Move Back Due Date
---
## Problem 

You want to push back the due date for an assignment to allow students
more time to complete it.

## Solution 

This recipe assumes that you have already created an assignment (see
[Create An Assignment](CreateAnAssignment.html)).

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Assignments** tab:

**Note:** only users who have instructor permissions can create new
assignments.  If you don't have instructor permissions, you will not see
the **Assignments** tab at all.  If this is the case,
[Contact Your Administrator](ContactYourAdministrator.html) for assistance.

**Step 1: Pick the course**.  Click the radio button next to the
course offering for which you want to edit an assignment.  Once you've
picked the course offering, click "Next".

**Step 2: Pick the assignment**.  You will see the list of
assignments that you have already created for this course offering.
Select the assignment you wish to edit.  Click "Next".

**Step 3: Edit assignment properties**.  This page shows both the
shared **properties for all instances of this assignment**, as well
as the **properties unique to this course offering**.

Under the properties unique to this course offering, click the
calendar icon next to the due date.

Select a different due date on the calendar.  Remember that you can
change the time fields at the bottom of the calendar by click-and-drag.

Once you have made your changes, click "Finish".

## Discussion 

If you change the due date for an assignment, the late penalties
and/or early bonuses applied to each submission that has already been
received will be updated automatically.

Suppose that your due date has already passed, and a number of
students have already submitted late and received a penalty.  But you
decide that the entire class really needs more time.  Change the due
date, and all existing submissions will have their scores and feedback
automatically adjusted to reflect the new due date--it will be just as
if they were really turned in on-time all along.
