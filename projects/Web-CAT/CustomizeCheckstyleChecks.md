title: Customize Checkstyle Checks
---
## Problem 

You are using the [JavaTddPlugin](JavaTddPlugin/), but you want to customize or completely turn off the Checkstyle
static analysis checks used by the plug-in.

## Solution 

If you just want to turn off (disable) the Checkstyle checks, the
[JavaTddPlugin](JavaTddPlugin/) provides an option in its reusable option
set to disable Checkstyle, so just check the box for that option.

However, if you want to change/customize the Checkstyle checks, walk though
the [SIGCSE 2009 Workshop](Sigcse2009Workshop/) exercise 4: [Configuring coding style checks](Sigcse2009Workshop/StaticChecks.html).
