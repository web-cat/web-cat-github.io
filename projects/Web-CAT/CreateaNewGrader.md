title: Createa New Grader
---
## Problem 

You want to create an account for a grader, graduate teaching assistant, or other
course staff that assists with assignment grading tasks.

## Solution 

If the person already has a Web-CAT account (because they are/were a student
in a different class, or you followed the steps to [Createa New User](CreateaNewUser.html)), then just
follow the recipe to [Add Another Grader](AddAnotherGrader.html).

If the person does not have an account yet, first [Createa New User](CreateaNewUser.html) (you can assign
an access level of 40) and then [Add Another Grader](AddAnotherGrader.html).

## Discussion 

Grader permissions allow a user to view, modify, and download assignment scores and student work, as well as
make comments on, mark up, and download student source code.
