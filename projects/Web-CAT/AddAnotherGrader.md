title: Add Another Grader
---
## Problem 

You want to add another grader or teaching assistant to an existing
course offering that you manage.  Graders can help in grading and
commenting on student submissions, but do not have permission to
create or edit assignments, or to edit course rosters.

## Solution 

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Courses** tab, and then click the **Properties** subtab:

<img href="img/courses-properties-tab.png"/>

**Note:** only users who have instructor permissions can edit
course offerings.  If you don't have instructor permissions, you will
not see the **Courses** tab at all.  If this is the case, contact your
Web-CAT administrator for assistance.

**Step 1: Pick the course**.  Click the radio button next to the
course offering you want to edit.  Once you've picked the course
offering, click "Next".

**Step 2: Edit course properties**.  You can use this page to
edit the URL associated with your course offering or access your
course roster.  You can also remove other instructors or graders
by clicking the trash can icon next to their names.

**Click the "Add" button** in the last row of the grader/teaching
assistant list to add another grader/TA.

On a new page, you will see the current list of graders at the
top, followed by a list of the user accounts that exist on the
server.  You can use the icons next to the User ID and Name column
headers to sort up or down by either field.  Page through the list,
and then **Click the "Add" button** next to the individual(s) you
want to add as grader(s) for your course offering.

## Discussion 

Only user accounts that already exist are shown as potential
graders for adding.  If you want to add another user who is not
listed, [Contact Your Administrator](ContactYourAdministrator.html) for help.

Note that graders have higher global permissions than students,
although they are not able to access any extra features other than
grading activities in the specific course offerings for which they
are graders.  All users, regardless of current permission levels,
appear in the candidate list for graders.  When an instructor adds
an existing account as grader on his or her course offering, the
selected user's permission level is automatically upgraded to that
needed for grading, if necessary.
