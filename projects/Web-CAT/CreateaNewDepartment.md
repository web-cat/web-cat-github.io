title: Createa New Department
---
## Problem 

You want to add a new department (with its own courses) to your Web-CAT
server.

## Solution 

This task requires **administrator privileges**.

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html), then click on the **Administer** tab and then the
**Edit Database** subtab.

Select **Department** from the Entities list at the top of the page and then click
the **New** button.

Fill in your department's information.  The **abbreviation** is the prefix used on
the department's course numbers, like "CS" or "CSE", etc.  The **name** is
the department's full name, like "Computer Science".  The institution is the
authentication domain to which this department belongs.

After entering all information, click **Save**.

## Discussion 

Normally, the first department is created when you complete the Web-CAT
self-installation wizard.  You'll only need this recipe if you want to include
courses from multiple departments (or multiple institutions) on your
server.
