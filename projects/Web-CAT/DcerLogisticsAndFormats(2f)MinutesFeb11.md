title: Dcer Logistics And Formats ( 2f ) Minutes Feb11
---
Jan Erik and Steve met, and discussed some of the materials that were posted
on this wiki.  See the starting page for more details:

[Dcer Logistics And Formats](../DcerLogisticsAndFormats.html)

Jan Erik liked the way the se-example2.zip came out.  Steve
Suggested that if Jan Erik were to add some of the additional files to
the example for his interviews, it would be a nice package, too.  Particularly if you
added demographic data on your subjects in the data.csv file (all the stuff in your
metadata summary regarding subject background info ... well, what parts of it you have
available, anyway).

Jan Erik also suggested that it would be valuable to use a more structured form
for transcript data to promote tool-processability of the transcripts.
Is there a more structured text format for the interviews you would recommend?

I agree that it would be preferable to use a more structured format, but the problem is that
if there is not a standard format available, it will be difficult to get many contributors
(besides us ;-)) to use it.

I think the term in text mining for this is "semi-structured text".  Most text mining tools
try to work in a flexible/forgiving way with such documents.

Action items for next week:

* I think if we each (well, Brian, Jan Erik, and Kat) could try to apply this strawman format to some dataset, then we'd start to uncover where things are missing or don't fit well.  Steve didn't have time to package up the interview data that Brian sent, so Brian, you can start there if you like.
* Steve will try to draft up some of the stuff he wrote about the format in the form of a "how to upload" help page for a hypothetical web site.
