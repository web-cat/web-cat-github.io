title: Provide Student Hints
---
## Problem 

You have a Web-CAT assignment that uses instructor-written reference tests and you
want to add hints to your reference tests to help students figure out what is wrong with their
code or their understanding of the behavior required in your assignment.

## Solution 

If you have not gone through the Sigcse2007Workshop, take a look at
Sigcse2007Workshop[/ Grading Options](/GradingOptions.html).  That workshop exercise explains how to
add basic hints to Java assignments.

Afterward, read [Java Tdd Plugin / Hint Control](JavaTddPlugin/HintControl.html)
to learn about other controls, including how to suppress hints when
needed (for a single test case method, or an entire test class), how
to give different weights to tests, and more.

## Discussion 

## The discussion discusses tradeoffs inherent in the solution and other possible solutions
