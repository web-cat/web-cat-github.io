Choose the **Results** tab, and then:

If you have recently made a submission, you are shown the results for this most recent submission as soon as you click the Results tab.  Otherwise, click the **Past Results** sub-tab entry under the Results tab to select among all of your past Web-CAT submissions.

**Step 1: Pick your course**.  Click the radio button next  to the course to which your assignment belongs, and then click "Next".
If your course is not listed, then contact your instructor.

**Step 2: Pick your assignment**.  Click the radio button next to the assignment for the submission you want to look up, and then click "Next".  If your assignment is not listed, then contact your instructor.

**Step 3: Pikc the submission**.  You will see a list of submissions, along with their corresponding times and scores, with the most recent submission first.  Click the radio button next to the specific submission that you want to view for this assignment. 

**Step 4: View your results**.  The results from the submission you have selected will appear.  You can [Interpret Your Feedback Report](InterpretYourFeedbackReport.html).

You can also [View Graphs Of Results](ViewGraphsOfResults.html) to see how your scores change over time as you make submissions, or to compare your latest score to those of others in your class.

## Discussion 

Course staff can use the **Grading** tab to look up the results of students in their courses.  See the recipes for graders in the [Web-CAT Cookbook](Cookbook.html).
