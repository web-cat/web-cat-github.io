title: Give Early Bonuses
---
## Problem 

You want to set the policy for an assignment so that students who
finish an assignment early receive a bonus.

## Solution 

This recipe assumes that you have already created an assignment (see
[Create An Assignment](CreateAnAssignment.html)).

Follow the same steps as you would to [Set Late Policy](SetLatePolicy.html).

When you are editing the **submission rules**, check the box to
**"award bonus points for early submissions"**.

Fill in the blanks to set the bonus policy, just as you would to set a
late policy.

## Discussion 

If you edit a submission rule profile, your changes will affect all
assignments that use this profile.
