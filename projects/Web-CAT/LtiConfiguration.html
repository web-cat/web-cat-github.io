title: LTI Configuration Instructions
---
<p>
Web-CAT now supports LTI integration with learning management systems
(LMS) to allow for single-sign-on support from an LMS, and automatic
grade passback to the LMS gradebook.
</p>

<h2>Add Web-CAT to an LMS Course</h2>
<p>
To use Web-CAT in an LTI-compatible Learning Management System (LMS), you
will need to install Web-CAT as an external LTI application. Depending on
the LMS, this may be done system-wide, or at the level of individual
courses. For system-wide installation, talk to your LMS administrator. For
individual courses, follow the steps below.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Set Up Course Offering(s) on Web-CAT</h3>
<p>
Before connecting your LMS course to Web-CAT, first create your Web-CAT
course offering(s) normally. Set up instructor or grader access for your
course staff, and upload your course roster(s).
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Install Web-CAT as an LTI App</h3>
<p>
If Web-CAT is not installed system-wide on an LMS, instructors will
typically add it to their individual courses on the LMS instead. To do
this, you'll need 4 pieces of information:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tool Name:</strong> Web-CAT<br/>
<strong>Configuration URL:</strong> <a href="https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/Web-CAT/WebObjects/Web-CAT.woa/wa/ltiConfiguration">https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/Web-CAT/WebObjects/Web-CAT.woa/wa/ltiConfiguration</a><br/>
<strong>Consumer Key:</strong> (get from your Web-CAT administrator for your school/LMS)<br/>
<strong>Consumer Secret:</strong> (get from your Web-CAT administrator for your school/LMS)
</p>
<p>
If your school is using its own Web-CAT server, you'll want to customize
the Configuration URL shown above so you use your own server's LTI
configuration definition--the URL shown above is the one for Virginia
Tech's main Web-CAT server.
</p>
<p>
Follow your LMS instructions for adding Web-CAT as an external LTI tool in
your course using the information shown above. For reference, you can read
the Canvas instructions for doing this:
</p>

<h2>Use Web-CAT for an LMS Assignment</h2>
<p>
Before Web-CAT can use used in a specific assignment, it must be added as
an external LTI tool to the course (or system-wide)--see the instructions
above. Next, you must also configure it for each assignment where Web-CAT
will be used using the steps below.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create Your Assignment Writeup</h3>
<p>
To use Web-CAT in an assignment, you will write your assignment instructions
as you normally would in your LMS. Perform that step first (you can always
edit the assignment later if corrections are needed).
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create Your Assignment on Web-CAT</h3>
<p>
Next, create the assignment on Web-CAT as well. Set up your assignment's
reference tests and any grading options that are necessary.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Copy Your Assignment URL into Web-CAT</h3>
<p>
Visit your assignment writeup on your LMS, and copy the URL for the
assignment writeup page. For example, on Canvas your assignment URL might
look like this example:
</p>
<p><strong>https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/58933/assignments/282390</strong></p>
<p>
Now, edit your assignment's properties on Web-CAT and paste this value into
the URL box:</p>
<p><img height="83" src="img/assignment-url-setting.png" width="398"/></p>
<p>
Note that the example URL shown here includes both the course ID from the
LMS, and also the assignment ID. For Canvas URLs, Web-CAT will automatically
extract the assignment's ID from the URL. For other LMSes, there is a
separate entry for the LTI ID used for the assignment.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Web-CAT as an External LTI Tool</h3>
<p>
To use Web-CAT in an assignment, you will configure the assignment on
your LMS to use an external tool for assignment submissions. Follow your
LMS instructions for using an external LTI tool to accept assignment
submissions. For reference, you can read the Canvas instructions for
doing this:
