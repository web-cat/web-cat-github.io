[Web Objects](WebObjects.html) is a commercial application framework produced by Apple.  It is designed to make it easy to field web applications.  It includes a database persistence layer that works in conjunction with an object-to-relational mapping, template-based separation of presentation from business logic, support for clustering and application lifecycle management, and a number of other features.  ["Web-CAT"] is built on top of [Web Objects](WebObjects.html).
