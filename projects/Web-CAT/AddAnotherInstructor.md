title: Add Another Instructor
---
## Problem 

You want to add another instructor to an existing course offering
that you manage.  Other instructors have all the same rights and
permissions that you do with respect to this course offering.

## Solution 

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Courses** tab, and then click the **Properties** subtab:

<img href="img/courses-properties-tab.png"/>

**Note:** only users who have instructor permissions can edit
course offerings.  If you don't have instructor permissions, you will
not see the **Courses** tab at all.  If this is the case, contact your
Web-CAT administrator for assistance.

**Step 1: Pick the course**.  Click the radio button next to the
course offering you want to edit.  Once you've picked the course
offering, click "Next".

**Step 2: Edit course properties**.  You can use this page to
edit the URL associated with your course offering or access your
course roster.  You can also remove other instructors or graders
by clicking the trash can icon next to their names.

**Click the "Add" button** in the last row of the instructor list
to add another instructor.

On a new page, you will see the current list of instructors at the
top, followed by a list of the user accounts with instructor-level
permissions at the bottom.  You can
use the icons next to the User ID and Name column headers to sort
up or down by either field.  Page through the list, and then
**Click the "Add" button** next to the individual(s) you want to
add as instructor(s) for your course offering.

## Discussion 

Only user accounts that already exist, and that already have global
instructor-level permissions are shown as potential instructors for
adding.  If you want to add another user who is not listed,
[Contact Your Administrator](ContactYourAdministrator.html) for help.
