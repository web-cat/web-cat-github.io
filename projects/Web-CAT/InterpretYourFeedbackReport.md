title: Interpret Your Feedback Report
---
## Problem 

You have submitted and assignment to Web-CAT and you want to know how to
interpret the feedback results you received.

## Solution 

We're still working on this recipe, so we've just got some starter information
for now.

The feedback you get for an assignment depends on the plug-in(s) the
instructor has selected to grade submissions for the assignment.  However,
most students are likely to get feedback from some of our most-used
plug-ins.

Some of the feedback elements are common across all plug-ins.  For a
summary, see the [Submission Walkthrough](SubmissionWalkthrough.html) movie (24Mb, 5min), which
also provides a basic walkthrough of how to interpret the feedback results
for a Java submission graded using the [JavaTddPlugin](JavaTddPlugin/).

For more detail, you can also look at the following recipes:

* [Interpret Java Tdd Feedback](InterpretJavaTddFeedback.html)
* [Interpret Cpp Tdd Feedback](InterpretCppTddFeedback.html)
* [Improve Your Testing](ImproveYourTesting.html)
