## Problem 

You want to install Web-CAT for the first time.

## Solution 

This movie goes along with the [Install Web Cat](InstallWebCat.html) recipe.  Note that a [Web Objects](WebObjects.html) license is **no longer required** to
install Web-CAT, so the self-installation wizard for the current release no longer prompts for your license
number during installation (we just haven't updated the movie yet!).  Also, note that after you unpack the WAR
file, start your servlet container, and pull up the web page for Web-CAT the very first time, there may be a substantial
delay (up to several minutes) before the page appears while Web-CAT downloads and self-installs any available
updates.  Be patient, and the first page of the installation wizard will eventually appear.
