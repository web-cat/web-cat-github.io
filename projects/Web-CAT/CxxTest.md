title: Cxx Test

[CxxTest](CxxTest.html) is an [xUnit](http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm) software testing framework for writing C++ unit tests.  It is similar to [JUnit](http://www.junit.org) in how it operates.  Unlike [CppUnit](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit), it does not require one to understand templates, and it automatically self-registers the test cases you write.

You can visit the [CxxTest home page](http://cxxtest.sf.net) for more information.
