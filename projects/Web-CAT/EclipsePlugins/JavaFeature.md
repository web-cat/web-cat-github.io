title: 'Eclipse Plugins: Java Feature'
---
The **Web-CAT Eclipse Java Feature** provides Eclipse users with a customized, student-oriented interface for developing Java solutions.
Our Java feature is designed to support students.  Some key features are:

* Full Eclipse-style support for Java development
* A streamlined interface for students based upon [Gild](http://gild.cs.uvic.ca)
* Support for static checks within the IDE that mirror those we use on ["Web-CAT"], so students will get warnings earlier during development
* Eclipse's built-in JUnit support
* Built-in electronic submission of assignments using our [Eclipse Plugins/Submission Plugin](SubmissionPlugin/)


## Install the Web-CAT Eclipse Java Feature 

You can [install this feature](http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/eclipse) directly from our Eclipse feature site.
