title: 'Eclipse Plugins: C++ Feature'
---
The **Web-CAT Eclipse C++ Feature** provides Eclipse users with a customized, student-oriented interface for developing C++ solutions.

Our C++ feature is designed to support students.  Some key features are:

* Full Eclipse-style support for C++ development (we use g++ on top of cygwin or unix, via the Eclipse CDT)
* Custom plug-in support for writing and executing test cases using [CxxTest](../CxxTest.html) via our [Eclipse Plugins/CxxTest Plugin](CxxTestPlugin.html)
* Built-in electronic submission of assignments using our [Eclipse Plugins/Submission Plugin](SubmissionPlugin/)


## Install the Web-CAT Eclipse C++ Feature 

You can [install this feature](http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/eclipse) directly from our Eclipse feature site.
