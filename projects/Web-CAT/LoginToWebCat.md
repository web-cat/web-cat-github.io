title: Login To Web Cat
---
## Problem 

You want to login to Web-CAT.

## Solution 

Logging in depends on what institution you belong to (i.e., usually which college or university you are at) and
which Web-CAT server your institution uses.  Many institutions use the Web-CAT server at Virginia Tech.
Others run their own server.

So, to successfully login, you need to know three things: the **URL used to access your server**, plus your
**user name and password**, and the **institution you belong to**.

For the **URL to access your server**, it depends on whether your class is using the Web-CAT server at
Virginia Tech, or whether there is a local server at your school.  If you are using the VT server, you can login
at http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/login.html.  Actually, you can just visit this login page and check the **institution**
drop-down list to see if your school is there.  If it's not, then you'll have to contact your instructor to find
out what URL to use.

For your **user name and password**, it also depends on which Web-CAT server you are using and which
institution you belong to.  Virginia Tech users will use their university-assigned PID and PID password to
login.  Users from other institutions that are using the VT server usually have a local user name and local
password just for Web-CAT.  For students, these accounts are usually set up by your instructor, so ask
for help if you are unsure.  Most instructors give students the same user name on Web-CAT that the student
uses at their local school.  Further, Web-CAT usually generates a new random password for each new
student account it creates, and tries to e-mail that initial password to you.  Afterwards, you can
[Change Your Password](ChangeYourPassword.html) to something else if you like.

OK, now that you have the information you need, you can login (which is _way_ easier than reading
this page!):

1. Point your web browser at the URL for your Web-CAT server (try http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/login.html if you don't know about a local Web-CAT server at your institution).  The login page should have some text fields that look like this:

<img href="img/login.png"/>

1. Enter your user name and password.
1. Select your institution from the **Institution** drop-down list. /!\ Don't forget this step!

## Discussion 

The Virginia Tech Web-CAT server also hosts a number of evaluation accounts that allow prospective
instructors from various institutions to try out Web-CAT's features.  If you are trying out Web-CAT,
**be sure to select Guest User as your institution** when you are logging in.

If all else fails, e-mail the administrator of your Web-CAT server.  Go to the login URL that you are
supposed to use, and look for the administrator's e-mail address (which, at a minimum, should be
in the "Comments to..." link at the bottom of the login page).  E-mail the Web-CAT administrator to
ask for help.

Note that it is possible for administrators of local Web-CAT servers to replace the "standard" login page with a
custom login page for their users.  The most common reason to do this might be to change the branding or
style of the front page, or to eliminate the Institution drop-down list.  So if your login page doesn't have an
institution list, don't worry about it.
