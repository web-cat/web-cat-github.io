title: Look Up Assignment Results
---
## Problem 

You want to look up the results and feedback for a submission you have recently made
to Web-CAT.

## Solution 

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Results** tab:

<img href="img/results-tab.png"/>

If you have recently made a submission, you are shown the results for this most recent submission as soon as you click the Results tab.

If you want to view results for a different submission, or if Web-CAT does not show any results here, then follow the instructions to [Look Up An Old Submission](LookUpAnOldSubmission.html) instead.

Once you find your submission results, you can [Interpret Your Feedback Report](InterpretYourFeedbackReport.html).

You can also [View Graphs Of Results](ViewGraphsOfResults.html) to see how your scores change over time as you make submissions, or to compare your latest score to those of others in your class.

## Discussion 

Course staff can use the **Grading** tab to look up the results of students in their courses.  See the recipes for graders in the [Web-CAT Cookbook](Cookbook.html).
