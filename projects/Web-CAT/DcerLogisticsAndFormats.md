title: Dcer Logistics And Formats
---
This is a small space I carved out for our group to keep materials on-line.  This will make it easy for us to distribute and share
files and other resources.  It will also provide a nice space to prototype some stuff, like "how to" instructions or documentation
of the metadata requirements and upload format as they would appear on the web.

### How to Create a Dataset 

I tried writing a tutorial on how to put together a dataset in the format documented below.  However, I ended up producing a rough HTML prototype of an "upload wizard" that would guide a researcher through creating/uploading a dataset for the first time (and the next time, and the next time ...).

Walk through it to get a feel for what a researcher would have to do to create/upload their data:

### Metadata 

Jan Erik consolidated our various ramblings on required metadata elements into this [/ Metadata Summary](/MetadataSummary.html)

### Upload Format 

* Read this description of the [/ Zip File Structure](/ZipFileStructure.html)
* Read this [/ Example Metadata File](/ExampleMetadataFile.html)
* Look at these examples:
  * <a href="attachments/jem-example1.zip">jem-example1.zip</a>
  * <a href="attachments/se-example2.zip">se-example2.zip</a>
  * <a href="attachments/bh-example3.zip">bh-example3.zip</a>
