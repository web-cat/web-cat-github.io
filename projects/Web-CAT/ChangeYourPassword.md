title: Change Your Password
---
## Problem 

You want to change your Web-CAT password.

## Solution 

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Home** tab, and then click the **My Profile** subtab:

<img href="img/home-my-profile-tab.png"/>

You'll see the basic information that Web-CAT knows about you.  You can edit the fields you like here.

To change your password, enter a new password in the **New Password** field.  Retype your new
password in the **Confirm Password** field.  Then click **Apply** to save your new password
(and any other changes you have made).

If your new password and the confirmed version don't match, Web-CAT will ask you to try again.

## Discussion 

Web-CAT only allows you to change passwords when it stores its own copy of your password locally.
For some institutions, Web-CAT may use an external authentication mechanism, like a campus-wide
password system.  If your account works this way, then Web-CAT **won't show** you a new password or
confirm password text field.  Instead, you have to use your institution's external mechanisms for changing
your password.

Unfortunately, the **My Profile** page does not currently give any feedback when you save your changes,
so there is no indication that your password was changed successfully.  If you don't get any errors, then
it has been changed.  We're working on adding better feedback on this page.
