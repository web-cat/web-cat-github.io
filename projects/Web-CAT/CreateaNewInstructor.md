title: Createa New Instructor
---
## Problem 

You want to create an account for an instructor.

## Solution 

If the person already has a Web-CAT account (because they are/were a student
in a different class, or you followed the steps to [Createa New User](CreateaNewUser.html)), then just
follow the recipe to [Grant Instructor Permissions](GrantInstructorPermissions.html).

If the person does not have an account yet, then [Createa New User](CreateaNewUser.html) and assign
them an access level of 50.

## Discussion 

## The discussion discusses tradeoffs inherent in the solution and other possible solutions
