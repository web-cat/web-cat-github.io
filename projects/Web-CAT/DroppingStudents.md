title: Dropping Students
---
## Problem 

You want to drop one or more students who are enrolled in a course offering
that you manage.

## Solution 

[Login To Web Cat](LoginToWebCat.html) if you are not already logged in.

Choose the **Courses** tab, and then click the **Properties** subtab:

<img href="img/courses-properties-tab.png"/>

**Note:** only users who have instructor permissions can edit
course offerings.  If you don't have instructor permissions, you will
not see the **Courses** tab at all.  If this is the case, contact your
Web-CAT administrator for assistance.

**Step 1: Pick the course**.  Click the radio button next to the
course offering you want to edit.  Once you've picked the course
offering, click "Next".

**Step 2: Edit course properties**.  You can use this page to
edit the URL associated with your course offering, or you can use the
**Add** buttons to [Add Another Instructor](AddAnotherInstructor.html) or [Add Another Grader](AddAnotherGrader.html).
Click "Next".

**Step 3: Edit student roster**.  This page allows you to enter or
modify the list of students enrolled in your course offering.  At the
top of the page, you will see a list of students who are currently
enrolled in your course offering.

You can use the icons next to the User ID and Name column headers to sort
up or down by either field.  If there are more than about 30 students,
they will be shown 30 at a time, along with controls for you to page
through the list.

Find the individual(s) you wish to drop, and then click the trash can
icon in the "Action" column to the right of their name(s).

Click "Finish" when you are done.

## Discussion 

You cannot use CSV files to remove (drop) students.
