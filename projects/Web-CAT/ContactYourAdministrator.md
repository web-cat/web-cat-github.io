## Problem 

You have a problem that you don't know how to solve, or that requires permissions that your
account does not have.

## Solution 

Contact your Web-CAT administrator.

Within Web-CAT, every page contains a **Comments to:** link in the footer that lists the e-mail address for the administrator of your Web-CAT server.  Use it to send a request for help. 

## Discussion 

There are three separate avenues for help available within Web-CAT, so please choose the most appropriate path.

For help on the user interface, or to find out what a particular control does, Click the **help link** on the upper right of the Web-CAT page you are on.

To make a comment about Web-CAT's features, to report a bug, or to suggest improvements or request additional features, click the **feedback link** on the upper right of the Web-CAT page you are on.

To request administrative assistance, particularly for instructors who need to change or alter something that they do not have permission to fix themselves, use the **comments to:** link in the footer to directly e-mail your site administrator.
