title: Improving Student Feedback
---
This is where the Web-CAT [Advisory Board](AdvisoryBoard.html) maintains its list of prioritized issues on how the feedback that Web-CAT provides to students can be improved.

Priorities can be indicated using the symbols {1} , {2} , and {3} .  See [Help On Smileys](HelpOnSmileys.html) for other symbols that may be used.

### Feedback Issues and Suggestions 

This section contains active feedback issues from students.

* **More useful hints**: The hints from instructor-written test cases need to provide more value.
  * Most importantly, hints are most useful if they give some indication of what was going on during the failure, rather than just what kind of failure (or symptom) occurred.
  * It is bad if Web-CAT submissions are open too late, and too close to the due date!!
  * It is also bad if the assignment specification changes a lot, especially if it changes a lot once submissions are open!

### Feedback Issues Resolved 

Once student-reported feedback issues have been resolved, they will be moved to this section.
